      - Implement a wrapper API using AWS SDK to allow external applications to manage users and groups.
  - **Secure Access**:
    - Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for secure and auditable SSH and RDP access to VMs.
    - Avoid direct access to VMs over the internet; instead, use SSM to establish secure connections.
  - **Multi-Providers Support**:
    - **AWS EC2 Instances**: Use SSM Agent for remote access.
    - **Akamai and Sakura Internet VMs**:
      - Install the SSM Agent on Akamai and Sakura Internet VMs.
      - Use AWS Systems Manager to manage and access these VMs securely without the need for VPN connections.
  - **Cost-Effectiveness**:
    - Leverage AWS Managed Services to reduce the overhead of managing individual access controls.
    - Automate access management and monitoring to minimize manual intervention.
  - **Automated Command Execution**:
    - Use AWS Systems Manager to execute commands with predefined templates or on-demand to manage and deploy applications or configurations automatically.
    - Support for cron jobs and triggers (e.g., new SSL imported/renewed on AWS ACM) to update remote servers immediately.

By leveraging AWS Directory Service and implementing a wrapper API using AWS SDK, along with a third-party application for a user-friendly UI, you can automate the management of users and groups across both Linux and Windows servers. This solution ensures secure, efficient, and centralized access control, making it easier to manage your infrastructure.

### 5. SSL Certificate Management for Multi-Provider Servers
- **Service**: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), AWS Lambda
- **Description**: Manage and deploy SSL Certificates to servers hosted on AWS EC2, Akamai Compute, and Sakura Internet VPS. This includes adding, updating, renewing, and regenerating certificates with CSR. Additionally, deploy certificates to AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Network Load Balancer (NLB).
- **Automation**: Use AWS Lambda to automate the deployment and renewal process.
