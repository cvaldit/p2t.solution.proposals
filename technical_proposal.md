    - **Authorization**: Fine-grained access control policies allow you to define who can import, export, rotate, revoke, and manage certificates.
    - **Accounting**: Detailed logs and audit trails track all certificate management activities, ensuring full accountability and transparency.
  
  - **Flexibility**: **AWS ACM** supports the import of custom SSL/TLS certificates from any provider, including Sectigo and Let's Encrypt. This flexibility allows you to centralize all your certificates in a single, secure vault, simplifying management and enhancing security.
  
  - **Ease of Access**: **AWS ACM** provides an intuitive interface for importing, exporting, rotating, revoking, and managing the lifecycle of your certificates. This ease of access ensures that you can efficiently manage your certificates without complex procedures.
  
  - **Compliance**: **AWS ACM** complies with various industry standards and regulations, including PCI DSS, HIPAA, and SOC. By centralizing your certificates in **AWS ACM**, you can ensure that your certificate management practices meet stringent compliance requirements.
  
  - **Automation**: **AWS ACM** automates the renewal and deployment of certificates, reducing the risk of expired certificates and ensuring continuous secure communications. Integration with **AWS Lambda** allows for further automation of custom workflows.

By centralizing your SSL/TLS certificates in AWS ACM, you can leverage AWS's trusted infrastructure, advanced security features, and compliance with industry standards to ensure a secure and efficient certificate management process. This approach simplifies the management of certificates from various providers, providing a single, secure vault for all your SSL/TLS needs.
